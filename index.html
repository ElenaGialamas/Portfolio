                  <h3>Introduction</h3>
                  <p>
                    Our team of five was faced with the challenge of creating a
                    VR game within a three-month timeframe. With the requirement
                    of utilizing cutting-edge VR technology, we set out to
                    deliver an immersive and visually appealing tower defense
                    experience.

                  <h3>Project Scope and Approach</h3>
                  <p>
                    To optimize our limited time while ensuring scalability, we
                    decided to develop a tower defense game. With a focus on the
                    VR medium, we dedicated ourselves to creating a captivating
                    world with custom-made assets, visual effects, and
                    hand-painted textures. For development, we employed Unreal
                    Engine and Visual Studio, alongside Blender and Procreate
                    for visual components. Our implementation involved a
                    combination of C++ programming and Unreal's Blueprint visual
                    scripting language.

                  <h3>My Responsibilities</h3>
                  <p>
                    I took charge of implementing the building system, enabling
                    players to strategically place offensive and defensive
                    towers throughout the virtual world. Additionally, I
                    undertook the creation of enemy models and integrated
                    animations to enhance their behavior and interactions within
                    the game. I was also responsible for painting textures and
                    some of the visual effects.

                  <h3>Enhancing Immersion and Gameplay</h3>
                  <p>
                    Our objective was to create an immersive experience that
                    went beyond the traditional tower defense gameplay of
                    placing towers and passively observing. To achieve this, we
                    implemented shooting mechanics, enabling players to actively
                    engage with the game environment. By incorporating the
                    player as an additional variable within the game world, we
                    aimed to enhance strategic decision-making and foster
                    dynamic gameplay experiences.

                  <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
                  <p>
                    Throughout development, we encountered two key challenges.
                    Firstly, we had to carefully manage performance for the VR
                    platform. Optimizing polygon count, effects, etc. was
                    essential to ensure smooth gameplay and a seamless player
                    experience. Secondly, designing the user interface (UI) for
                    VR proved complex. We needed a UI that moved naturally with
                    the player, allowing intuitive selection without cumbersome
                    menu interactions. While our solutions were sufficient,
                    further improvements would have greatly enhanced gameplay.
                    This underscored the importance of proper UI design and made
                    us rethink our design approach for future projects.

                    We were thrilled to have the opportunity to showcase our
                    game at the GG Bavaria Convention in Munich as well as our
                    university's career day. Our professor entrusted us with
                    representing our university and its game development course.
                    During the events, we also showed the GameLab, a dedicated
                    space equipped with modern hardware for student projects.

                  <h3>Introduction</h3>
                  <p>
                    When my university announced a game jam organized by the
                    Franco-German Youth Office, I applied and secured a spot. I
                    traveled to Angoulême, France, where the game jam commenced
                    with the theme: "climate change." Our challenge was to
                    develop a game concept addressing this issue, catering to
                    students in Germany and France. The game aimed to be a
                    serious educational tool, suitable for classroom use. With
                    limited time, we formed teams comprising German and French
                    university students, ready to bring our vision to fruition.

                  <p>
                    Our project, "Another Kind of Date," materialized as a
                    politically-driven dating simulator. Picture yourself as a
                    mediator, navigating the complexities of international
                    diplomacy by engaging in unconventional "dates" with
                    fictional world leaders. The goal? Persuade them to support
                    climate-friendly legislation. We spent two days refining our
                    concept and seeking feedback through several sales pitches,
                    guided by a jury comprised of professional game designers,
                    climate change experts, education specialists, and competing
                    teams.

                    We emerged as the winners of the contest, which provided us
                    with the necessary financial support to work on our project
                    for an additional six months. Our task shifted towards
                    creating a comprehensive Game Design Document, encompassing
                    essential elements such as budget allocation, timeline
                    planning, key features, captivating gameplay mechanics, and
                    strategic partnerships. Within the team, my primary
                    responsibility revolved around overseeing the art direction
                    and working on game design aspects.

                  <p>
                    Working with an international team presented its share of
                    challenges. Throughout those six months, we encountered
                    difficulties in coordinating schedules due to academic and
                    work commitments. Text messages became our primary mode of
                    communication, although it wasn't always smooth sailing.
                    However, the mistakes we made taught us invaluable lessons
                    about the significance of effective communication in project
                    management. Now, I am better prepared for future
                    international collaborations.

                  <h3>Introduction</h3>
                  <p>
                    Embarking on my very first web development project, I aimed
                    to create a portfolio website that would not only be a
                    learning experience but also make use of newer technologies.
                    Instead of taking the easy route of copying existing
                    portfolio templates, I wanted to make something unique. With
                    my love for both 2D and 3D art, I decided to dive into
                    Three.js to bring 3D models into the mix.

                  <h3>Designing with Stylized 3D</h3>
                  <p>
                    My design process kicked off with me getting my hands dirty
                    in Blender. I created a stylized room as the centerpiece for
                    the website. This room set the tone for the entire design,
                    especially when it came to colors. I wanted it to look good,
                    even as a standalone art piece. So, I had two goals in mind:
                    to make it visually appealing with a pleasing color scheme,
                    and to keep the model's poly count low to ensure smooth
                    performance without sacrificing the artistic flair.

                  <h3>Learning the Basics</h3>
                  <p>
                    Being a total newbie in web development, I had to start from
                    scratch and learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My aim was to
                    grasp the fundamentals and figure out one of the many
                    approaches to web development. But the most important thing
                    was to make it work in the end! Despite the challenges, it
                    was a fun experience, and I'm eager to continue learning and
                    exploring more.

                  <p>
                    Of course, I couldn't go completely framework-free and
                    tackle everything on my own, since that would have taken far
                    too long. So, I decided to embrace the power of Three.js to
                    handle all the 3D assets, and I enlisted the help of GSAP's
                    scrolltrigger feature to add camera and room animations.

                  <p>
                    After weeks of working on the website on the side, I thought
                    everything was going smoothly. But when I resized the window
                    to a mobile format, I discovered that the website layout
                    faltered when viewed on different devices. It took some
                    tweaking and troubleshooting, especially with the 3D aspects
                    of the website, to make the website look decent on both
                    desktop and mobile devices.
