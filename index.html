                    <p>
                      For our semester project, our team of six created Project
                      Greenhouse, a 3D puzzle platformer. With a time limit of
                      three months our goal was to make a short prototype that
                      conveyed the vision of the game. We used Unreal Engine for
                      the programming, Procreate and Photoshop for 2D Assets,
                      and Blender for making custom animations and 3D assets.

                    <h3>My Tasks</h3>
                    <p>
                      At the start of the project, I was mostly responsible for
                      programming tasks. I mainly focused on the camera and
                      movement mechanics. I also worked on smaller functions and
                      troubleshooting. Additionally, I took on implementing
                      animations and setting up the player character in the game
                      engine. Since I also have experience in art and
                      illustration, I contributed to the artistic tasks as well.
                      Toward the end of the project, I created textures and
                      illustrations to visually support the storytelling.

                    <h3>Challenges</h3>
                    <p>
                      Like with any project, our team needed some time to get
                      started. We had to discuss the main idea of the project a
                      lot. It quickly became clear that our original concept
                      wasn’t possible within the given timeframe. However, it
                      was unclear how exactly we would adjust the project
                      instead. Initially, we planned to focus a lot on the story
                      of the game. But since our main goal was to create a fun
                      product, we shifted our focus to game mechanics and game
                      design. By focusing more on the technical aspects, we lost
                      a clear and shared goal. As mentioned above, our biggest
                      issue was "scope creep." This term refers to when a
                      project’s requirements or goals grow beyond the original
                      plan. We knew that we wanted to make a fairly complex
                      game, but in the first few weeks, we had too many ideas
                      for the story and mechanics. We wouldn't have had enough
                      time to do all of them. It’s important to set clear
                      boundaries at the start of a project and keep realistic
                      expectations.

                    <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
                    <p>
                      In summary, working on this project was a very valuable
                      learning experience. Throughout the project, I improved my
                      skills in programming, animation, technical art,
                      illustration, and design. But even more importantly, I
                      gained more experience with teamwork and communication.
                      Good and consistent communication often doesn’t seem so
                      important in the initial project planning phase. It’s easy
                      to get lost in technical details, possible
                      implementations, and ambitions. But enjoyable and
                      productive work depends heavily on good teamwork. This not
                      only helped us work much more efficiently but also created
                      a more pleasant work environment.

                    <p>
                      In this project I developed a machine learning model to
                      estimate the average salary for Software Developers based
                      on factors like experience, education, and country of
                      employment. The goal was to create a tool to centralize
                      salary information, helping users avoid the hassle of
                      researching across multiple sources.

                    <p>
                      The project used the Stack Overflow Developer Survey data.
                      After data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing
                      values, categorical encoding, and standardization, three
                      models were trained and evaluated: Linear Regression,
                      Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. The
                      final model pipeline, consisted of both preprocessing and
                      the model. It was created and tuned through grid search.
                      It was deployed as a web app using Streamlit.

                    <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
                    <p>
                      The project highlighted the importance of careful data
                      cleaning and preprocessing. Both missing and unbalanced
                      that created problems which will need to be addressed
                      better in the future. Splitting the data and avoiding data
                      leakage during preprocessing is also of importance.
                      Additionally, the project reinforced the need for well
                      thought out imputation techniques to improve model
                      accuracy. Complex models might require a more in depth
                      hyper parameter tuning. Given the time, an iterative
                      approach to model training is beneficial.

                    <p>
                      Our team of five set out to create a VR game in the span
                      three months. One of the main focus points of the project
                      was including modern VR technology. For that we made us of
                      a VR treadmill. We aimed to build a visually immersive and
                      engaging tower defense game.

                    <h3>Scope and Technologies</h3>
                    <p>
                      With limited time, we decided on a VR tower defense game
                      to balance scalability with quality. Our goal was a rich
                      visual experience that worked well in VR. We used Unreal
                      Engine and Visual Studio for core development, with
                      Blender and Procreate to create custom assets and
                      textures. Our development involved both C++ programming
                      and Unreal’s Blueprint visual scripting.

                    <h3>My Responsibilities</h3>
                    <p>
                      I developed of the building system, enabling players to
                      place towers within the world. I also designed enemy
                      models and integrated animations to make interactions feel
                      more dynamic. Additionally, I created textures and visual
                      effects to enhance the game's atmosphere.

                    <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
                    <p>
                      Two main challenges emerged during development. First,
                      optimizing performance for VR was a large focus. For this
                      purpose we tried controlling polygon counts and effects,
                      so that lag and techinical difficulties woudn't hinder the
                      game play. Second, designing a user interface for VR was
                      challenging. The UI needed to move with the player for
                      easy interaction. Finding a good distance and giving good
                      interaction feedback was a big challenge. While our
                      solutions worked, we saw how refining UI design could
                      further improve gameplay.

                      day. Our professor chose our team to represent the
                      university’s game development program. We presented in the
                      GameLab, a space for student projects equipped with the

                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                      Embarking on my very first web development project, I
                      aimed to create a portfolio website that would not only be
                      a learning experience but also make use of newer
                      technologies. Instead of taking the easy route of copying
                      existing portfolio templates, I wanted to make something
                      unique. With my love for both 2D and 3D art, I decided to
                      dive into Three.js to bring 3D models into the mix.

                    <h3>Designing with Stylized 3D</h3>
                    <p>
                      My design process kicked off with me getting my hands
                      dirty in Blender. I created a stylized room as the
                      centerpiece for the website. This room set the tone for
                      the entire design, especially when it came to colors. I
                      wanted it to look good, even as a standalone art piece.
                      So, I had two goals in mind: to make it visually appealing
                      with a pleasing color scheme, and to keep the model's poly
                      count low to ensure smooth performance without sacrificing
                      the artistic flair.

                    <h3>Learning the Basics</h3>
                    <p>
                      Being a total newbie in web development, I had to start
                      from scratch and learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My aim
                      was to grasp the fundamentals and figure out one of the
                      many approaches to web development. But the most important
                      thing was to make it work in the end! Despite the
                      challenges, it was a fun experience, and I'm eager to
                      continue learning and exploring more.

                    <p>
                      Of course, I couldn't go completely framework-free and
                      tackle everything on my own, since that would have taken
                      far too long. So, I decided to make use of Three.js to
                      handle all the 3D assets, and I took advantage of GSAP's
                      scrolltrigger feature to add camera and room animations.

                      After working on the website on the side for some time, I
                      thought everything was going smoothly. But when I resized
                      the window to a mobile format, I discovered that the
                      website layout faltered when viewed on different devices.
                      It took some tweaking and troubleshooting, especially with
                      the 3D aspects of the website, to make the website look
                      decent enough on both desktop and mobile devices.
