I am thrilled to share my experience of participating in a contest organized by the Franco-German Youth Office.

The contest brought together young individuals from across France and Germany to create a game concept addressing climate change. 
I was fortunate enough to be one of the selected participants from Germany and traveled to France to take part in the event.

During the contest, we had to form teams consisting of both Germans and French individuals. 
We had only two days to brainstorm and create a game concept that would help raise awareness about the issue of climate change. 
Our team worked tirelessly, utilizing our diverse perspectives and backgrounds to come up with an innovative idea.

At the end of the two days, we had to present our game concept in a final sales pitch to a panel of judges. 
Our team's hard work paid off, and we were ecstatic to learn that we had won the contest!

Our success meant that we were given the unique opportunity to work on our game concept for an additional six months. 
Over the course of the six months, our team worked on developing the game concept further. 
We had to create a comprehensive game design document that included vital details such as the budget and timeplan, key features, 
gameplay loop, planned partnerships, and more.

As a team, we had to allocate tasks and responsibilities among ourselves to ensure that the project ran smoothly. 
I was primarily responsible for the art and game design aspects of the game.

Despite being a small team of only five people, we were able to work efficiently and effectively. 
We had to overcome the challenge of working from different countries, which meant that we had to communicate regularly and utilize 
online tools to collaborate effectively.

I won a climate change game concept contest organized by the Franco-German Youth Office. Our team, consisting of both Germans and French individuals, 
developed a comprehensive game design document remotely for six months, with me primarily responsible for art and game design. It was an incredible 
opportunity that helped me gain valuable skills like effective communication, time management, and task prioritization.

Our team worked together to create a tower defense game called "Crystal Defense" within just three months. 
The game is designed to challenge players to strategically place barricades and turrets in order to defend a crystal from incoming waves of enemies. 
To add an extra layer of complexity and excitement to the game, we implemented various spells that players can trigger while walking through the level. 
These spells can slow down or poison the enemies and make it easier for players to defend the crystal.

One of the standout features of the game is its beautiful graphics and immersive soundtrack, which help create a captivating and engaging world for players to explore. 
The game can be played using a VR headset, making it feel even more real, and supports most VR models. 
Additionally, we implemented the "Virtualizer Elite 2" treadmill, which enables players to move through the level as if they were really there.

As a member of the development team, I was responsible for several key aspects of the game, including modeling, animation, visual effects, post-processing, 
and programming some of the mechanics. This experience allowed me to learn a great deal about working with new technology and hardware in a short time frame. 
I also had the opportunity to work closely with my team members and learn from them, which was invaluable to my growth as a game developer.
